    <p> <i>Hiking</i> is a passion of mine, i've gone hiking as far as I can remember and it is a hobby that you don't need much to begin.
    this good because hiking is good for the body as well as for the mind. Being constantly glued to your phone is followed by
    a litany of problems that we will talk about later. Getting out in nature is one of the main reasons to go hiking, its why 
    hunters enjoy going out, the thrill of the hunt combined with the presence of nature is amazing. I've spent countless hours
    exploring the outdoors and once thing remains consitant and that is being prepared. In this guide I will teach you basic techniques 
    in ways that i've broken down on how to navigate as well as navigating by map.
