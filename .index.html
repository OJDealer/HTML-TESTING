                In November 3, 1992, at approximatly 2:35am, 12 Class 1 and 89 Class 3 Crypits broke containment
                in the Sierra Holding Facility manned by TerraDef Sec Co in Northern Wyoming. In the years since,
                multiple confirmed sightings of both Class 1 and 2 cryptids were reported with the the majority of 
                reports coming from rural counties. TDSC Strike Teams 3 and 5 were dispatched in May of 2023 and 
                successfully were able to detain Codename NBO 5643, and Codename Cat Eyes, registered as NBO 3117.
